Everybody,

everybody has the potentials of genius.

The human brain is far more

powerful than a computer

and than a supercomputer.

It's potential is still not known

but everytime we put a boundary on it

the brain busts through that

boundary

and goes further and

further,

so brilliance is a potential

for everybody.



The nice thing about daydreaming,

is that daydreaming

which has been considered

a sign of incompetence,

a sign of a bad academic potential,

we now realize that daydreaming

can break you

or make you

the great geniuses did something different,

they "daydream" big.



The left side of the brain

is dominant,

in the following kinds of skills:

words, numbers, lines, logic and analysis.

The right side tends to be dominant

in rhythm, color, spacial awareness, imagery and daydreaming.

And you must know for example,

creativity is not as nearly everyone in the world thinks

but, creativity involves logic,

it involves analysis,

it involves words, songs.

So the conclusion is that both sides

of the brain, of the cortex

need to be used in harmony with each other,

then you get an explosion of

Creativity.
