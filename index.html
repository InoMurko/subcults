        <h1 id="title">To navigate the quest is to become one with it</h1>

        <p>Who are we? Where on the great vision quest will we be reborn? Our conversations with other dreamweavers have led to a refining of consciousness. Humankind has nothing to lose.</p>

        <div class="article_inner">

        <p>We must learn how to lead non-local lives in the face of delusion. This mission never ends. We must develop ourselves and develop others.</p>

        <p>How should you navigate this angelic stratosphere? The dreamscape is calling to you via morphogenetic fields. Can you hear it? </p>

        <blockquote>It can be difficult to know where to begin.</blockquote>

        <p>Knowledge is the driver of love. We dream, we grow, we are reborn. By evolving, we reflect. Have you found your path? How should you navigate this sacred quantum matrix?</p>

        <p>We can no longer afford to live with illusion. It has finally come to this. After years of arguments, once again we have to listen to the minds that have created the glue that holds this world together.</p>

        <p>Only a lifeform of the multiverse may ignite this harmonizing of divinity. We can no longer afford to live with selfishness. You must take a stand against greed. It is a sign of things to come.</p>

        <p>This vision quest never ends. Eons from now, we beings will vibrate like never before as we are guided by the solar system. </p>

        <p>Imagine a flowering of what could be.</p>

      <p>I learned then what science was about: it was patience. If you looked, and you watched, and you paid attention, you got a great reward from it — although possibly not every time. As a result, when I became a more mature man, I would painstakingly, hour after hour, for years, work on problems — sometimes many years, sometimes shorter times; many of them failing, lots of stuff going into the wastebasket — but every once in a while there was the gold of a new understanding that I had learned to expect when I was a kid, the result of observation.</p>
      <h3>from What Is Science?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>There is evidence to suggest that our situation is every bit as hopeful as it is desperate. As Alvin Tofller noted in his famous book Future Shock, there are more scientists alive and working today than in all previous history combined, and this means that we will see more changes in the next two decades than in any 1,000 years of the past. </p>
      <h3>from Ten Good Reasons To Get Out Of Bed In The Morning</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>The world looks so different after learning science. For example, trees are made of air, primarily. When they are burned, they go back to air, and in the flaming heat is released the flaming heat of the sun which was bound in to convert the air into tree, and in the ash is the small remnant of the part which did not come from air that came from the solid earth, instead. These are beautiful things, and the content of science is wonderfully full of them. They are very inspiring, and they can be used to inspire others.</p>
      <h3>from What Is Science?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Dr. Leary uses the symbol JZ (intelligence squared) to represent this new evolutionary factor; it stands for intelligence studying intelligence, the nervous system studying the nervous system. Dr. John Lilly refers to it as the self-metaprogrammer, the human brain feeding back self-change directions to the human brain scientifically. In simple language, man is graduating from being the conditioned animal in the behaviorist cage to becoming whatever he wills to become.</p>
      <h3>from Ten Good Reasons To Get Out Of Bed In The Morning</h3>

      <div>
      <p>"The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind." I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing — not much, but enough that they miss fame.</p>
      <h3>from You and Your Research</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>We need to remember that about 97 per cent of all humanity’s art, science, culture, and philosophy has come from economically secure aristocracies supported by human slaves. When all humanity becomes an economically secure aristocracy supported by mechanical slaves, Aristotle’s imagined utopia will be practical. Immeasurable intelligence will be released to seek goals even beyond immortality, perhaps beyond spacetime as we know it. </p>
      <h3>from Ten Good Reasons To Get Out Of Bed In The Morning</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Objectivity and subjectivity were traps that people fell into. I prefer the terms "insanity" and "outsanity." Insanity is your life inside yourself. It's very private and you don't allow anybody in there because it's so crazy. Every so often I find somebody that I can talk to about it. When you go into the isolation tank outsanity is gone. Now, outsanity is what we're doing now, it's exchanging thoughts and so on. I'm not talking about my insanity and you're not talking about yours. Now, if our insanities overlap then we can be friends.</p>
      <h3>From here to Alternity and Beyond interview with John Lilly</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Unlike imprinting which requires only one experience and sets permanently into the neurons, conditioning requires many repetitions of the same experi­ence and does not set permanently. Behaviorists, also, know how to reverse conditioning by counter-condition­ ing, but only Dr. Timothy Leary has claimed to know how to reverse imprinting.</p>
      <h3>from Quantum Psychology by Robert Anton Wilson</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Well, Patanjali, for instance, in 400 B.C. said, "When you reach the highest form of samadhi, you realize there are hundreds more beyond that." I agree; there's no limit.</p>
